# ChatGPT is not available in Azerbaijan

The inability to use ChatGPT, an amazing technology, in Azerbaijan suddenly led me to deep thoughts.

# Maybe it's not about the language

I don't know the exact reason, but perhaps they don't want the model to be influenced by people like us who speak or write in 'poor' English and use the "gözəlçə" 'open source' models. Or they think that our population wouldn't benefit if they turned the 'open-source' technology into a business.

# What does we need to do?

It feels very comfortable to have such easy access to information. When searching for information on a topic, you don't waste time on Reddit, Quora posts, YouTube videos, or any articles. It is as dangerous as being able to do it. Consider that there is a serious brain drain in the country and the rest are not taken seriously, maybe we have missed the boat before starting this information race. We need serious commitments in Azerbaijan to create a new generation of programmers and scientists.

# What is the problem?

"Another issue shows that the more late access to information you have, the more ignorant you are. There is very little content available in the Azerbaijani language in the country and we are all seriously at fault, but we must understand that programming is not just about CRUD.

I will not say that we are new to this field and comfort ourselves, we need to do serious work urgently to avoid being a vassal of any super power in the information age that lies ahead. We still think about finding a name for an electric outlet or finding an alternative to the word "zaryatka", but we feel strange when we say it in Azerbaijani. Our linguists should play an active role here. Today, if a 12-year-old child wants to learn coding and create something, they will first encounter an English language mountain."

# Finally

"Lastly, I want to say that the first law of thermodynamics never changes. Energy can be created or dispersed. Energy is transferred from one state to another or from one place to another. The best example of this is the slavery. Humanity never changes, but the next "vibe" for humanity will probably be information slavery. My only wish is that our society will not be the vassal of any country in the information race that lies ahead.

I have added ChatGPT to my website with its APIs. It appears a bit weak compared to the websites it gives in the APIs. This is probably due to the maximum number of tokens. "
